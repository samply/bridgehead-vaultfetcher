# Samply Bridgehead Vaultfetcher
The Samply Bridgehead Vaultfetcher aims to provide an easy way to read environment variables from a self-hosted [Vaultwarden]() instance. For this purpose the [Bitwarden Cli]() tool is used.

This project is currently in the prototyping phase and could be subject to unannounced breaking changes.
